# Lunor Language Support – VS Code Extension

This Visual Studio Code extension adds language support for the **Lunor** language – a domain-specific, indentation-based markup language used to define UI views with embedded logic, Markdown, and component structure.

-   🧠 **Hover support** with contextual info about components, directives, and expressions
-   🛠 **Autocomplete** suggestions for built-in commands and component attributes
